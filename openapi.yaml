                        Type of gateway this data plane proxy manages.
                        There are two types: `DELEGATED` and `BUILTIN`. Defaults to
                        `DELEGATED`.

                        A `DELEGATED` gateway is an independently deployed proxy (e.g., Kong,
                        Contour, etc) that receives inbound traffic that is not proxied by
                        Kuma, and it sends outbound traffic into the data plane proxy.

                        The `BUILTIN` gateway type causes the data plane proxy itself to be
                        configured as a gateway.

                        See https://kuma.io/docs/latest/explore/gateway/ for more information.

                This is useful to expose the health endpoints of the application so the
                orchestration system (e.g. Kubernetes) can still health check the
                application.

                Deprecated: this feature will be removed for Universal; on Kubernetes, it's
                not needed anymore.

                          allows cluster information to be kept up to date, without sending a
                          potentially large amount of active health checking traffic for no reason.
                          Once a cluster has been used for traffic routing, Envoy will shift back
                          to using the standard health check interval that is defined. Note that
                          this interval takes precedence over any other. The default value for "no

                              Random selects a random available host. The random load balancer generally
                              performs better than round-robin if no health checking policy is configured.
                              Random selection avoids bias towards the host in the set that comes after a failed host.

                              onto a circle (the “ring”) by hashing its address; each request is then routed
                              to a host by hashing some property of the request, and finding the nearest
                              corresponding host clockwise around the ring.

                                        Percentage of local traffic load balanced to tag is computed by dividing weight by sum of weights from all tags.
                                        For example with two affinity tags first with weight 80 and second with weight 20,
                                        then 80% of traffic will be redirected to the first tag, and 20% of traffic will be redirected to second one.
                                        Setting weights is not mandatory. When weights are not set control plane will compute default weight based on list order.
                                        Default: If you do not specify weight we will adjust them so that 90% traffic goes to first tag, 9% to next, and 1% to third and so on.

                    Type of gateway this data plane proxy manages.
                    There are two types: `DELEGATED` and `BUILTIN`. Defaults to
                    `DELEGATED`.

                    A `DELEGATED` gateway is an independently deployed proxy (e.g., Kong,
                    Contour, etc) that receives inbound traffic that is not proxied by
                    Kuma, and it sends outbound traffic into the data plane proxy.

                    The `BUILTIN` gateway type causes the data plane proxy itself to be
                    configured as a gateway.
